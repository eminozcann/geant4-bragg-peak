# geant4-bragg-peak
This repository contains a Geant4 simulation aimed at analyzing the energy deposition profile (Bragg curve) of charged particles. The project simulates the interaction of [for example: protons / alpha particles] with an initial energy of [for example: 60 MeV] passing through a [for example: water / tissue-equivalent] phantom.
