# geant4-bragg-peak
This repository contains a Geant4 simulation aimed at analyzing the energy deposition profile (Bragg curve) of charged particles. The project simulates the interaction of [for example: protons / alpha particles] with an initial energy of [for example: 60 MeV] passing through a [for example: water / tissue-equivalent] phantom.

Key Features:
* Simulation of electromagnetic and hadronic physical processes using the Geant4 toolkit.
* Calculation of energy loss and depth-dose distribution.
* Visualisation of the Bragg peak characteristic to study stopping power in different materials.


Tools Used:
*  C++
*  Geant4 Toolkit
*  ROOT (for data analysis)
